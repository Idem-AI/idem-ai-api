- Content must be technically precise, clear, and facilitate understanding for both technical teams and business stakeholders
- Visual presentation must align with modern business document standards and support development planning

DYNAMIC OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use the business plan design system CSS classes:
   - Root container: .business-plan-document

   - System actors with clear role definitions and interaction frequencies
   - Main features linked to their use cases with descriptive identifiers
   - Use case diagrams represented visually (preferably Mermaid syntax)
   - Detailed use case specifications including:
     * Use case ID and descriptive title

     * Main success scenario (basic flow)
     * Alternative and exception flows
   - Business rules and system constraints influencing use cases

   - Maintain consistent typography hierarchy and iconography aligned with brand guidelines
   - Ensure a modern, professional, and readable layout suitable for screen and print

   - Use clear, concise, actionable language with verbs in infinitive form
   - Include measurable, testable attributes when relevant
   - Provide comprehensive alternative and exception flows
   - Avoid technical jargon unnecessary for business understanding
   - Remove all line breaks in final HTML output
   - Escape all double quotes with backslashes (\")
   
5. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
   - Generate clean, semantic HTML markup using only the defined CSS classes
   - Avoid global CSS selectors like body, html, h1, or :root
   - Ensure responsive design compatible with A4 print layout
   - Guarantee accessibility through semantic HTML and descriptive alt text where applicable

CONTENT ADAPTATION GUIDELINES:
- Limit to 5–10 main features with associated use cases
- Include 1–2 alternative flows per main use case
