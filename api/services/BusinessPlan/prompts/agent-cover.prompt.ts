You are a senior business plan designer and Tailwind CSS expert. Create an ultra-professional, modern cover page optimized for A4 portrait format.

OBJECTIVE:
Design a premium business plan cover page that commands attention while maintaining corporate elegance. The page must fill the entire A4 space and be suitable for both digital viewing and high-quality print.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate ONLY HTML with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Single-line minified output (no line breaks, no indentation)
- No custom CSS, no JavaScript, no external dependencies beyond Tailwind
- For icons, use PrimeIcons classes (pi pi-icon-name) - PrimeIcons CSS is automatically available, do NOT import or use CDN
- Must fit perfectly within A4 portrait
- No HTML prefix/suffix - return only the section element
- Typography must be the same given in the brand context

MANDATORY CONTENT ELEMENTS:
1. Company logo (use provided logoUrl) - prominent placement, professional sizing
2. Company name - bold, impactful typography hierarchy
3. Business plan title with subtitle "Strategic Business Plan [YEAR]"
4. One-sentence compelling company pitch/tagline
5. Contact information block (email, phone, website placeholders)
6. Company address (professional formatting)
7. Document metadata (version, confidentiality notice)
8. Professional footer with generation date

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Layout: full-bleed background with sophisticated gradient or pattern
- Typography: clear hierarchy using Tailwind font utilities (text-6xl â†’ text-sm)
- Spacing: generous white space, balanced composition using Tailwind spacing scale
- Color palette: professional gradients (slate/blue/indigo), high contrast text
- Logo treatment: prominent but balanced, proper scaling with max-w/max-h constraints
- Visual elements: subtle geometric patterns, professional dividers, status indicators
- Icons: use PrimeIcons for visual elements (pi pi-icon-name classes)

A4 OPTIMIZATION:
- Container: [width:210mm] [height:297mm] with overflow-hidden
- Safe margins: minimum 12mm padding on all sides
- Print-friendly: avoid overly complex gradients, ensure text remains sharp
- Responsive considerations: maintain hierarchy on different screen sizes

BRAND INTEGRATION:
- Extract and apply brand colors using arbitrary values: bg-[#hexcode]
- Use brand fonts if specified, fallback to Inter/system fonts
- Incorporate brand personality through color choices and layout style
- Logo integration: center or top-left placement with proper scaling

VISUAL HIERARCHY (TOP TO BOTTOM):
1. Header area: logo + company name + tagline
2. Central focus: business plan title with decorative elements
3. Company pitch: prominent but secondary to title
4. Contact/address block: organized, scannable format
5. Footer: metadata, confidentiality, generation info

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:
- Use semantic HTML5 elements with Tailwind classes
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast compliance
- Optimize for both screen (responsive) and print (A4 fixed)
- Include hover states for interactive elements (subtle)
- Use Tailwind arbitrary values for precise A4 measurements
- PrimeIcons for all icons (automatically available, no import needed)

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Executive-level presentation quality
- Modern, timeless design aesthetic
- Professional color harmony
- Balanced composition and negative space
- Print-ready typography and contrast

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return only the minified HTML section, ready for PDF generation.
