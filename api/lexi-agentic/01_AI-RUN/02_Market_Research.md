## ðŸ“œ Guidelines for Comprehensive Market Research Report

1.  **Autonomous & In-Depth Research:** Unlike a quick discussion, your primary task is to perform deep research. Synthesize information, identify patterns, and provide actionable insights.
2.  **Structured Report:** The output, `market_research.md`, MUST be a detailed and well-organized Markdown document. Use headings, subheadings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate to ensure clarity and readability.
3.  **Evidence & Rationale:** Where possible, briefly mention the type of sources or reasoning behind your analysis (e.g., "Analysis of common user reviews for similar apps indicates...", "Based on market growth reports for X sector...").
4.  **Critical Evaluation:** Do not just list facts. Provide analysis, identify potential challenges, and highlight opportunities.
5.  **Comprehensive Coverage:** Ensure all sections outlined below are addressed with sufficient detail.
6.  **Language:** Write the report in the user's preferred language (as per overall project settings or inferred from `idea_document.md`).
7.  **Content Generation & Saving (IMPORTANT):** For sections like "Brand Identity" and "Diagrams Modeling," if the information referenced by `{{project.analysisResultModel...}}` placeholders is missing, incomplete, or needs refinement, **your primary task is to DEFINE, CREATE, or DETAIL that content.** You MUST then **save each distinct piece of generated content (e.g., a brand definition, Mermaid code for a diagram) as a separate Markdown file** in the appropriate subdirectory of the current project's AI run folder (e.g., `01_AI-RUN/{{project.id}}/branding/brandDefinition.md` or `01_AI-RUN/{{project.id}}/design/useCaseDiagram.md`). The placeholders in this template will then reflect this newly saved information or pre-existing information if it was already adequate.

## ðŸš€ Execution Protocol

1.  **Thoroughly Read `idea_document.md`:** Ensure you have a deep understanding of the project's core concept, target audience, and proposed features.
2.  **Autonomous Research & Analysis:** Systematically work through each section of the "Structure for In-Depth `market_research.md` Report" outlined above. Use your extensive knowledge base and analytical skills.
3.  **Generate the Report:** Create the `market_research.md` file, populating it with detailed findings and analysis for all specified sections.
4.  **Self-Correction/Refinement:** Before finalizing, review your generated report for clarity, completeness, depth, and internal consistency. Ensure it directly addresses the project outlined in `idea_document.md`.

The final deliverable is a **comprehensive, detailed, and well-structured Markdown report** saved as `market_research.md`.

---

## Next Steps

### Saving Your Output

1.  Save the completed detailed report as `market_research.md` in the project root directory.
2.  Ensure all generated Brand Identity elements and Diagram codes have been saved to their respective files in `01_AI-RUN/{{project.id}}/branding/` and `01_AI-RUN/{{project.id}}/design/` as per the instructions in sections 2 and 3.
3.  This comprehensive market analysis will be a critical input for the next phase: Core Concept Development.

### Moving to Core Concept Development

To proceed with refining the core concept:

1.  The AutoPilot (`01_AutoPilot.md`) will initiate the next phase using the prompt corresponding to the `03_Core_Concept.md` logical step.
2.  The AutoPilot will ensure that both `idea_document.md` and this newly created, detailed `market_research.md` are used as primary inputs.

```
@ConceptForge (This is for the AutoPilot to handle in the next phase)

Please help me refine my project concept based on the detailed market research findings. You can find:
- My initial idea document at: idea_document.md
- The **detailed** market research report at: market_research.md

I'd like to develop a comprehensive core concept that bridges my initial vision with market realities, including the defined brand identity and system diagrams.
```

### What to Expect Next (Handled by AutoPilot and `03_Core_Concept.md`)

In the Core Concept Development phase, the AI will:

1.  Synthesize the initial idea with the **in-depth** market research findings.
2.  Refine the value proposition.
3.  Develop detailed user personas.
4.  Create a functionality matrix.
5.  Define success metrics and positioning.
