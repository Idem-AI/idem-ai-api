### Moving to Market Research

To proceed with market research:

1. Open the prompt file in `01_AI-RUN/` that corresponds to the `02_Market_Research.md` logical step. (Ensure `00_AutoPilot.md` or your manual process calls the correct actual filename for market research).
2. Share it with your AI agent.


### What to Expect Next

In the Market Research phase, the AI will:

1. Analyze your idea for market viability
2. Research competitors and market trends
3. Identify target user segments
4. Provide pricing and go-to-market strategies

This market validation is crucial before proceeding to refine your core concept in the next phase.
