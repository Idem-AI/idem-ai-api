# Core Concept Development Prompt

## Context Awareness

**Previous Phases:**

- Idea Document `01_Idea.md`
- Market Research `02_Market_Research.md`

**Expected Inputs:**

- A completed `01_Idea.md` containing your initial project concept.
- A comprehensive `02_Market_Research.md` report validating market fit.

**Current Phase:** Core Concept Development

## Next Steps

### Moving to PRD Generation

To proceed with creating the Product Requirements Document:

1. Open the prompt file in `01_AI-RUN/` that corresponds to the `04_PRD_Generation.md` logical step. (Ensure `00_AutoPilot.md` or your manual process calls the correct actual filename for PRD generation).
2. Share it with your AI agent.
3. Reference your `03_Core_Concept.md` document and the PRD template (typically `01_AI-RUN/Template/PRD_template.md`).

```
@PRDarchitect

Please create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document based on my refined core concept. You can find:
- The core concept document at: `03_Core_Concept.md`
- The PRD template structure is in the prompt

I need a detailed PRD that follows the template structure precisely while incorporating all elements from my core concept.
```

### What to Expect Next

In the PRD Generation phase, the AI will:

1. Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document following the template structure
2. Incorporate all elements from your core concept
3. Develop detailed functional and non-functional requirements
4. Define the technical architecture and design specifications
5. Establish testing, deployment, and maintenance plans

This PRD will serve as the definitive blueprint for product development in subsequent phases.
